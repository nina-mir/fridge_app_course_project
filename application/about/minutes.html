	<hr>
	<ul>
		<li>Sept.5&nbsp Our first team meeting, basically, a meet-and-greet between team memebers. Eveyone introduced themselves and went over
		their web devskills and previous projects, in addition to their goals in this team project.</li>
		<li>Sept.7&nbsp We discussed our software dev stack, choice of server, how to obtain a server access for free, AWS Educate account, 
		choice of web dev framework (decided to learn Django), and each member's role. Doug was not present but he was in the loop via Discord messages.</li>
		<li>Sept.12&nbsp Thanks to Abhy, we now have access to AWS. He set-up a server that all all who were present for this meeting (Doug was absent)
		managed to access it remotely. All that is left to do: Installing relevant packages, Django, Python, ... deplying our about page to this server, so that 			we can meet Milestone 0 expectation in time. </li>
		<li>Sept.14&nbsp [pre-Meeting messages on Discord: Abhy wonders how to use Django on Apache webserver] Everyone but Doug was present. We got our servers 			on AWS running. All that is needed: installing the software packages as we have agreed upon. Josh is working on the M0 email to TA. Eveyone seem to be 			learning python and/or Django. We set up two serves on AWS(master server and test server). We have not yet agreed on method of input from the user for 			this project yet. 
		<li>Sept.19&nbsp [Everybody was present.] In class meeting, Gangzhaorige set up our server and software stack beautifully. Instructore discussed M1 with 			the class. Joshua started a google doc for M1 for everyone to contribute. Everybody wrote storylines. It seems our storyline is mostly for adults who are 			20-30 year olds. Nina is still working on the test server setup but got django installed successfully. Folks discussed the prototyping part. Wilson been 			studying the Python Django youtube videos.
		<li>Sept.21&nbsp [Everyone present bu Doug] Group dicussion on M1 objectives: Data definitions, story lines, functional features, prototyping issues, 			testserver issues, use of docker technology (if we a docker, we won't need a test server per Abhy!), questions about django frontend matters. This 			session lasted for about 2 hours. We completed the data defintions in the google doc of M1 so far. Nina will fix up the test server, Wilson is further 			studying Django tutorials, Abhy will look into OCR APIs (openCV).
