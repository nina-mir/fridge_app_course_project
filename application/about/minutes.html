		<li>Sept.5&nbsp Our first team meeting, basically, a meet-and-greet between team memebers. Eveyone introduced themselves and went over
		their web devskills and previous projects, in addition to their goals in this team project.</li>
		<li>Sept.7&nbsp We discussed our software dev stack, choice of server, how to obtain a server access for free, AWS Educate account, 
		choice of web dev framework (decided to learn Django), and each member's role. Doug was not present but he was in the loop via Discord messages.</li>
		<li>Sept.12&nbsp Thanks to Abhy, we now have access to AWS. He set-up a server that all all who were present for this meeting (Doug was absent)
		managed to access it remotely. All that is left to do: Installing relevant packages, Django, Python, ... deplying our about page to this server, so that 			we can meet Milestone 0 expectation in time. </li>
		<li>Sept.14&nbsp [pre-Meeting messages on Discord: Abhy wonders how to use Django on Apache webserver] 
		Everyone but Doug was present. We got our servers on AWS running. All that is needed is installing the software packages as we have agreed upon. Josh is 			working on the M0 email. Eveyone seems to be learning python and/or Django. We set up two serves on AWS( master server and test server). We have not yet 			agreed on method of input from the user for thisproject yet.</li>
		<li>Sept.19&nbsp In class meeting, Ganzhoragie set up our server and software stack beautifully. Instructur discussed M1 with the class. Joshua began a 		google doc for M1 for everyone to contribute. Everybody was present. Everybody wrote storylines. It seems our storyline is mostly for adults who are 			younger. Nina is still working on the test server setup but got django installed successfully. </li>
		<li>Sept.21&nbsp Group dicussion on M1 objectives: Data definitions, story lines, functional features, prototyping issues, test server issues, use of 			docker technology, questions about django front end matters. This session lasted for about 2 hours. We have completed the data defintions in the google 		doc of M1 so far. Nina will fix up the test server, Wilson is studying Django tutorials, Abhy will look into OCR APIs (openCV).</li>
		<li>Sept.28&nbsp Finished M1, work on competitive analytics and links to specific apps,  Exective summary is still left, Josh created a sample camera 			interface, Douge and everyone fininshed the user stories, data features, Gangzhairige is learing AWS picture extractor analyzer. </li>
