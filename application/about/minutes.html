	<ul>
		<li>Sept.5&nbsp Our first team meeting, basically, a meet-and-greet between team memebers. Eveyone introduced themselves and went over
		their web devskills and previous projects, in addition to their goals in this team project.</li>
		<li>Sept.7&nbsp We discussed our software dev stack, choice of server, how to obtain a server access for free, AWS Educate account, 
		choice of web dev framework (decided to learn Django), and each member's role. Doug was not present but he was in the loop via Discord messages.</li>
		<li>Sept.12&nbsp Thanks to Abhy, we now have access to AWS. He set-up a server that all all who were present for this meeting (Doug was absent)
		managed to access it remotely. All that is left to do: Installing relevant packages, Django, Python, ... deplying our about page to this server, so that 			we can meet Milestone 0 expectation in time. </li>
