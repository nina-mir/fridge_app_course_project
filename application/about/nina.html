		<p>     Nina Mir, <em>pronouns: they/them/theirs</em>, is a second year grad student in computer science
		at SF State University. While their academic background in undergraduate studies is not computer science, they took the leap to learn computer science because they realized solving abstract puzzles and creating something out of nothing in the virtual world is very appealing to them. Whle at school, they also work plenty of hours per week as a math/science tutor in San Francisco for Tutor Corps and independently helping clients in math, chemistry, physics, and SAT/ACT/GRE. They love interacting with people which is why they volunteered to be the <em>scrum master</em> in the CSC-648 group project. They have some knowledge in frontend dev (<code>HTML, CSS & JavaScript</code>, and <code>C/C++</code>. In this class project, they plan on learning as much as possible in frontend + backend dev. Upon graduation, they wish to have a job as a system administrator in an academic institution, or a programmer in a start-up involved in philantropy or public health. They expect to graduate in Fall 2020 -- fingers crossed!
